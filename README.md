# 🏓 Ping pong launcher

This was a fun little project I made over a weekend while in quarantine using an Arduino UNO board and some cardboard.

I made a ping-pong ball launcher that can be loaded and launches several balls in even intervals of time. A micro-servo pushes balls into two spinning wheels driven by 3-6V DC motors, and I used the Arduino IDE to upload the code to the Arduino.
